## French Toast

While BSBC serves a variety of entrees, they are most known for their brunch options. They offer various choices, such as breakfast sandwiches and burritos, oatmeal, hashes, and both savory and sweet french toast. There are two choices for sweet french toast: A banana variant as well as a coconut variant. I am not terribly fond of coconut flavors, so I always opt for the Banana Foster French Toast.

### Description

The sweet french toast meal, Banana Foster French Toast, is a wonderful blend of goodness. Starting with thick slices of egg batter-dipped challah bread, a brown sugar rum sauce is added for increased flavor. Toppings include sliced bananas and pecans, sprinkled with powdered sugar.

**All this for the moderate price of $8.95!**

### Review

{{< rating 4.5 5 >}}

Overall, this french toast receives a 4.5/5. The taste and flavor are splendid, the amount of food is perfect -- not too little, but not too much.

The only thing to complain about is the lack of crunch in the dish. The pecans provide some texture, but there is no caramelizing action on the bread. It can sometimes seem a little mushy, but not enough to ruin brunch.

#### Pros

- Appropriate amount of food
- Great flavor from rum sauce
- Very sweet
- Reasonable price

#### Cons

- Sometimes a little mushy
- Perhaps too sweet for some people

## Recommend?

**Absolutely.** If you like sweet breakfast dishes and are in or visiting Madison, WI, make sure to stop in at BSBC to try out this local brunch favorite.
