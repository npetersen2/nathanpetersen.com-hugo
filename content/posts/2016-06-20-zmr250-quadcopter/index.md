## Background

I got into the R/C hobby at a very young age, mainly with R/C cars. They weren't that nice, since I was so young, but boy were they fun. I remember I got a truck one year for Christmas and immediately started driving (and crashing) it. Since we were having Christmas at my grandparents, they didn't really like me hitting their walls with it, so they hid it from me for a while. Boy was I mad... I loved that thing!

After a few years of R/C cars, I lost interest. Sure they were fun, but I didn't want to invest in a nitro-powered car and the electric ones I had were too slow. Thus, I moved onto newer and more exciting things - that is until May of 2015, when I placed my first order for R/C plane/drone parts from [HobbyKing.com][hobbyking]. Ever since then, I've been hooked.

## Previous Experience
My first project was a cheap clone of the DJI 450 sized quadcopter.

## 3-D Printed Parts
While there is no absolute need for 3D printing parts for drones, sometimes it can be very helpful. For example, during a crash, dirt and mud can easily get into the motors. By 3D printing a motor shield and attaching it, debris can be kept out of the motor. This is just one example of a practically unlimited number of help parts one can print.

My ZMR250 build uses a number of 3D printed parts. Since this was my first foray into 3D printing and the ZMR250 frame is fairly popular, I opted to just use other people's designs for my quadcopter. I've attached the files below that I printed as well provided links to the original files from Thingiverse.
