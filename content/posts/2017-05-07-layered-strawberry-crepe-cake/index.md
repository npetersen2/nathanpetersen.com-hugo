### Assembling Cake

 - 1 lb strawberries

Cut one pound of strawberries into slices. Build crepe stack by spreading frosting across top of each crepe and stacking on top of each other, adding strawberries as desired. Once all crepes have been stacked, spread frosting on top of stack and fill with strawberry slices. Garnish with whipped cream.
