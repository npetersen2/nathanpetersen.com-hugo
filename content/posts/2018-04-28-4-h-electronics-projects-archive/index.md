## History

Growing up, I was a member of the All-School 4-H Club. While a member, I didn't really appreciate the experience; it seemed like a waste of time but looking back, a few aspects come to mind as helpful.

I took electronics projects for many years, from 2006 through 2011, and learned a lot. Each year, I created a display board to show at the county project exposition. The display board showcased a simple circuit that demonstrated a specific electronics principle. Along with the circuit display, I submitted a short write-up describing my time creating the project.

After six years, coming to college, and rediscovering my love for electronics, I decided to archive my past 4-H projects online as a way to remember and share them, hoping to inspire other beginning electronic hobbyists.
