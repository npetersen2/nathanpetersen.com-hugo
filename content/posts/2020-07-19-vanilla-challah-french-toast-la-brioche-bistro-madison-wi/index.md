### Description

The French Challah French Toast is one of the best dishes that is offered. Starting with three slices of thick cut Challah bread, a creme anglaise (English creme) is drizzled on. To top the dish, a mountain of fresh berries and bananas is added. Finally, whole caramelized pecans finish the spread and provide a rich added texture. Real maple syrup is provided in a side dish.

**All this will run you $11.50.**

*Note: if you opt for all the menu-listed toppings (bananas, fresh berries, and pecans), an extra $5 charge is applied!*
