## French Toast

La Brioche Bistro serves both breakfast and lunch / dinner entrees. The dishes have strong influences from French cooking. A typical entree may include lush bread, croissants, mixed greens, etc. The breakfast dishes include both sandwiches as well as sweet treats. Both crepes and french toast are offered.

### Description

The French Challah French Toast is one of the best dishes that is offered. Starting with three slices of thick cut Challah bread, a creme anglaise (English creme) is drizzled on. To top the dish, a mountain of fresh berries and bananas is added. Finally, whole caramelized pecans finish the spread and provide a rich added texture. Real maple syrup is provided in a side dish.

**All this will run you $11.50.**

*Note: if you opt for all the menu-listed toppings (bananas, fresh berries, and pecans), an extra $5 charge is applied!*
