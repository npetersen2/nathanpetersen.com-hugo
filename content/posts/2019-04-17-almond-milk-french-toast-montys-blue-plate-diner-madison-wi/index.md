#### While simple, this raisin french toast checks all the boxes.

## Where?

Monty's Blue Plate Diner ([montysblueplatediner.com](https://montysblueplatediner.com/)), located on the isthmus in Madison, WI, is a retro style diner which dates back to the early 1900s. The ambiance and decorations make for a warm and welcoming vibe -- this diner really transports its hungry guests back in time.

The food at Monty's is spectacular -- it's a well kept Madison secret. From burgers to pasta, cheese cake to french toast, no one will be left out. The entire restaurant strives to be vegan and vegetarian friendly, offering many options that cater to these groups. **The french toast being reviewed in this article is indeed vegan!**

## French Toast

While many different entrees are offered at Monty's Blue Plate Dinner, the french toast really struck my fancy. Vegan french toast is simply not very popular. Traditionally, french toast involves an egg wash which includes milk and eggs among other flavorings.

The Almond Milk French Toast, like the name implies, uses almond milk as the base for the wash, making the dish entirely vegan!

### Description

This entree is simple. It comes plain with real pure maple syrup on the side. Although simple, the french toast lacks little. Cinnamon swirl-raisin bread is dipped in their homemade almond milk with a blend of spices, then grilled to golden brown. This leaves a texture on the outer surface which provides a subtle crunch while eating -- a wonderful little detail.

**All this for the reasonable price of $8.99!**

### Review

{% rating 4.5 5 %}

Compared to all french toast, this simple french toast dish is missing a few key items. The lack of toppings such as fresh berries, nuts, or whipped cream is a bummer, but at the same time, the simplicity creates a beautiful dining experience. It goes to show that french toast doesn't need all the extra items to be wonderful -- Monty's almond milk french toast is wonderful on its own.

#### Pros

- Simple dish
- Appropriate amount of food
- Unlimited real pure maple syrup
- Reasonable price

#### Cons

- Lacks popular toppings

## Recommend?

**Yes.** Sometimes you need a break from the overly designed french toast dishes -- this is it. A classic french toast dish that will please everyone, even the vegan in the family!
