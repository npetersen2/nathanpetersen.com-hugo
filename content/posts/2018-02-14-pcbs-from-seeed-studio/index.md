## Background

During the past couple of months, I have been working on a new project that I call __Razzler: POV LED Top__. The final product is a toy top that one can spin, like the old-time toys. This top detects spinning and plays little animation patterns on it's line of LEDs, creating a persistence-of-vision (POV) display.

Since I wanted the Razzler to be small and compact, I needed to design a PCB on which to mount all my SMD components. This PCB wasn't _too_ complicated: just a two layer board with 6/6 mil clearances. I spent many hours of many nights laying out my first PCB for this project. Finally, I was satisfied with my design. I needed to get it produced.

## Why Seeed Studio?

I chose Seeed Studio ([seeedstudio.com](https://www.seeedstudio.com/)) to manufacture my newly designed PCB since it was affordable and had an easy-to-use website that seemed modern and trustworthy. I had also seen them recommended on other websites, like [this blog](http://andybrown.me.uk/).

Seeed Studio's web interface is very similar to other places, but just seems cleaner and better. I uploaded my gerber files and hit go. Only $4.90 for 10 boards!!! Amazing!

## Results

After waiting a few weeks, the boards showed up. A close inspection of all 10 revealed nothing wrong! I wasn't really pushing limits in this project, as I adhered to all their design rules, but they delivered good clean boards.

I really don't have anything to complain about... I have assembled multiple and they all work perfectly. The quality of the PCB is high enough that it doesn't affect my circuit; it just works.

I had read many things about cheap PCB houses creating poor looking silkscreens, but the silkscreens on my boards look just fine. No dotting like some places seem to produce.

__Overall, I am impressed by [Seeed Studio's cheap PCB service](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html).__ The quality is very nice for the price ($5!!!). I will be ordering revision two of the Razzler from them soon.
