During my recent trip to Door County with my girlfriend and dog, we looked all across the Internet for the best french toast dish to try, and boy did we find it.

### Description

Two slices of perfectly browned thick bread stuffed with pockets of Wisconsin cream cheese and Door County cherries. The sweetness of the cherries is definitely at the forefront of the flavor palette bite after bite. Fresh authentic Door County maple syrup covers the dish to top off the sweetness profile and compliment the cherry taste. There is really nothing like the stuffed french toast with locally sourced fruit, all for such low price.

**Grand total for this award winning (yet humble) brunch dish? $11.80** or $15.80 with side of meat. _Seems that inflation hasn't arrived in Northern Wisconsin_ :smile: :dollar:

### Review

{{< rating 5 5 >}}

*No brainer---simply trust the 1000s of people who voted this #1 in 2010 on GMA!*

#### Pros

- Fresh flavors local to the region
- Modest price tag for a national favorite
- Good size, not too big nor small
- Historic building creates a comfortable dining room

#### Cons

- Long long long wait times... we waited over 2 hours for our table on a Sunday morning during prime brunch time. Luckily, browsing the shops around Fish Creek make it easy to pass the time.

## Recommend?

**Of course. This should be on everyone's list during Door County trips.** The wait is worth it. Plus, there are numerous other entrees on the menu which will delight you, not just this stellar Door County cherry stuffed french toast. White Gull Inn does it again, just as they have been doing for over 100 years.
