## What Is This?

One afternoon, I was sitting in the office and I had an urge. To watch a YouTube video. But everyone knows that one shouldn't just open a big YouTube video on their screen at work! The simple answer was to just resize the window so it wasn't so visable. No no no no...

The problem with resizing a YouTube page is that there is too much extra stuff on the page. You've got comments, related videos, descriptions, and that big header. Okay, okay, okay, I know what you're thinking: just embed it! And that's exactly what I did.

I spent 15 minutes and made a web app that is basically just a script that makes a popup of an embedded YouTube video. You input the video URL from YouTube and it creates a window. Simple. Easy. Slick.
