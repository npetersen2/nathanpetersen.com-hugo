*I have been interested in photography for as long as I can remember.* I bought my first real camera in high school (Canon 6D) and have used it since; I love it! It came with to college at Wisconsin, and every once in a while, I get to break it out and snap some shots.

Here is a collection of my favorites pictures I've captured, sorted chronologically. I also have a photography portfolio website: [nppictures.net](http://nppictures.net). I haven't updated it recently, but I intend to redesign it and get it back up and running soon. Until then, I will upload my latest photographic content here.
