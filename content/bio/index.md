Nathan is a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin — Madison, pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering as part of WEMPEC. His research focuses on control of electric machines, specifically targetting magnetically levitated motor systems.

He believes that technologies are most disruptive when a passionate individual spans their entire lifetime — starting with initial research, to concept conception, through design and prototyping, to entrepreneurial roll out. Through his studies, he strives to change the world using this process.

To achieve high performance control of electric machines, cross-domain knowledge is required. The underlying physics must be understood, control theory must be applied, and high performance embedded systems must be used for implementation. Nathan thrives in multi-disciplinary environments, where his research and experience gives him the tools to succeed.
