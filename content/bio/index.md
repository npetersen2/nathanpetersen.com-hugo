Nathan is a PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Electrical Engineering as part of WEMPEC. His PhD research focuses on control of electric machines, specifically targeting magnetically levitated motor systems such as bearingless motors.

For his MS research project, Nathan designed and built the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC) platform, which is a collection of open-source hardware and software for controlling advanced electric machines. Check it out at [amdc.dev](https://amdc.dev/) or read the docs at [docs.amdc.dev](https://docs.amdc.dev/).

When Nathan is not in the research lab collecting data (using the AMDC) or writing his latest paper (appreciating $\LaTeX$), he enjoys building things, tinkering, and writing about it. His blog archives his ideas/projects/experiences over the years, ranging from website design to embedded systems to brunch reviews.

Nathan's CV is available [here](/CV_NathanPetersen_updated_2023_05.pdf).

<!--
He believes that technologies are most disruptive when a passionate individual spans their entire lifetime — starting with initial research, to concept conception, through design and prototyping, to entrepreneurial roll out. Through his studies, he strives to change the world using this process.

To achieve high performance control of electric machines, cross-domain knowledge is required. The underlying physics must be understood, control theory must be applied, and high performance embedded systems must be used for implementation. Nathan thrives in multi-disciplinary environments, where his research and experience gives him the tools to succeed.
