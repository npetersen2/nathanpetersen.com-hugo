    <description><![CDATA[Update April 2021  Silicon Labs has sold their I&amp;A Business.
My entire expereince at Silicon Labs, as discussed below, was in the I&amp;A division. Therefore, everything I say below is outdated, since the business/products no longer exist from Silicon Labs. Most links in this article to silabs.com are now invalid, but I will keep them intact for posterity.
   Well, thus concludes my summer at Silicon Labs, and boy was it great.]]></description>
