    <description><![CDATA[History Growing up, I was a member of the All-School 4-H Club. While a member, I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate the experience; it seemed like a waste of time but looking back, a few aspects come to mind as helpful.
I took electronics projects for many years, from 2006 through 2011, and learned a lot. Each year, I created a display board to show at the county project exposition. The display board showcased a simple circuit that demonstrated a specific electronics principle.]]></description>
