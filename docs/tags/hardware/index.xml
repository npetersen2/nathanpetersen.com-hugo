    <description><![CDATA[My custom light sensor installed in its window to read outdoor light levels" My custom light sensor installed in its window to read outdoor light levels  In a few quick evenings, I built a custom light sensor for my smart home to measure outdoor light levels through my window. In this post, I&rsquo;ll explain how I did it. We&rsquo;ll go over the electronic components and wiring, enclosure, software configuration, Home Assistant integration, and a few example plots of the illuminance levels.]]></description>

In May 2019, I complete my undergraduate schooling. It is not uncommon for students to decorate their graduation &ldquo;hats&rdquo; to personalize them and make them stand out in the crowd of graduates during the commencement ceremony. Typically, people create artwork related to the university they attended (i.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background My involvement in this project, the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC), happened because of my undergraduate Independent Study project done at UW-Madison during Spring 2018, advised by Prof. Eric Severson and affiliated with WEMPEC.
How did I get this opportunity? Eric, a relatively new professor, was looking for interested students to work on his projects. My name was recommended to him by other professors, so he reached out to me and I accepted the offer.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background Razzler: the Persistence of Vision LED Top" Razzler: the Persistence of Vision LED Top  During the summer of 2017, I started working on my first real electronics project. This project marks the first time I have ever seen an electronics project all the way through, from start to finish: initial idea, schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, board assembly, testing, device driver development, and full firmware creation.
I love LEDs and interactive toys, so I decided that I wanted to build a top that people could spin to entertain themselves.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[History Growing up, I was a member of the All-School 4-H Club. While a member, I didn&rsquo;t really appreciate the experience; it seemed like a waste of time but looking back, a few aspects come to mind as helpful.
I took electronics projects for many years, from 2006 through 2011, and learned a lot. Each year, I created a display board to show at the county project exposition. The display board showcased a simple circuit that demonstrated a specific electronics principle.]]></description>
