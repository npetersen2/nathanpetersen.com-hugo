    <description><![CDATA[Background The induction machine is one of the oldest AC electro-mechanical power conversion devices [1]. In the late 19th century, engineers pioneered the first single-phase induction motor, followed soon by the three-phase variant. Compared with other popular motor types (e.g. DC or synchronous), the induction motor is typically lower cost and has higher reliability. This has pushed the technology to become the dominant player in industrial applications. See Fig. 1a for an example induction motor.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Advanced Motor Drive Controller, Revision D fully assembled" Advanced Motor Drive Controller, Revision D fully assembled  The fourth hardware design revision (REV D) of the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC) from the Severson Research Group marks a huge step improvement in quality of design, physical size reduction, and functionality compared to previous designs.
Background About 2.5 years ago, I begin work on the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC), an open-source project designed for academic research in motor drives.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background My involvement in this project, the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC), happened because of my undergraduate Independent Study project done at UW-Madison during Spring 2018, advised by Prof. Eric Severson and affiliated with WEMPEC.
How did I get this opportunity? Eric, a relatively new professor, was looking for interested students to work on his projects. My name was recommended to him by other professors, so he reached out to me and I accepted the offer.]]></description>
