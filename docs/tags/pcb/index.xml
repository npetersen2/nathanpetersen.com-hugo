    <description><![CDATA[My custom light sensor installed in its window to read outdoor light levels" My custom light sensor installed in its window to read outdoor light levels  In a few quick evenings, I built a custom light sensor for my smart home to measure outdoor light levels through my window. In this post, I&rsquo;ll explain how I did it. We&rsquo;ll go over the electronic components and wiring, enclosure, software configuration, Home Assistant integration, and a few example plots of the illuminance levels.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Update April 2021  Silicon Labs has sold their I&amp;A Business.
My entire expereince at Silicon Labs, as discussed below, was in the I&amp;A division. Therefore, everything I say below is outdated, since the business/products no longer exist from Silicon Labs. Most links in this article to silabs.com are now invalid, but I will keep them intact for posterity.
   NOTE: Make sure you read this post after reading about my previous internship experience at Silicon Labs.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background My involvement in this project, the Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC), happened because of my undergraduate Independent Study project done at UW-Madison during Spring 2018, advised by Prof. Eric Severson and affiliated with WEMPEC.
How did I get this opportunity? Eric, a relatively new professor, was looking for interested students to work on his projects. My name was recommended to him by other professors, so he reached out to me and I accepted the offer.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background Razzler: the Persistence of Vision LED Top" Razzler: the Persistence of Vision LED Top  During the summer of 2017, I started working on my first real electronics project. This project marks the first time I have ever seen an electronics project all the way through, from start to finish: initial idea, schematic design, PCB layout, manufacturing, board assembly, testing, device driver development, and full firmware creation.
I love LEDs and interactive toys, so I decided that I wanted to build a top that people could spin to entertain themselves.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Background During the past couple of months, I have been working on a new project that I call Razzler: POV LED Top. The final product is a toy top that one can spin, like the old-time toys. This top detects spinning and plays little animation patterns on it&rsquo;s line of LEDs, creating a persistence-of-vision (POV) display.
Since I wanted the Razzler to be small and compact, I needed to design a PCB on which to mount all my SMD components.]]></description>
